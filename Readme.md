# About
Backend server made in Express that responds to Webhook calls from my Dialogflow chatbot. Both the chatbot and it's backend were made as a homework project for AGH Univeristy of Science and Technology. The chatbot acts as a representative of a made-up company that deals with installation of photovoltaics. 

The chatbot is available [here](https://bot.dialogflow.com/8e5ce5f4-c866-4931-b83d-768fcda65509), however it understands only Polish language.
